abstract: "Compared with Global Atmosphere 6 (GA6) of the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM), the dry bias over the Indian monsoon region in Global Atmosphere 7 (GA7) is significantly reduced. However, the physical processes controlling how this reduced dry bias in India influences rainfall teleconnections in the extratropics remain unclear. Thus, in this study, we use Rossby wave tracing in a horizontally nonuniform background flow to investigate how the improved simulation of monsoon rainfall in GA7 compared with GA6 affects extratropical rainfall teleconnections. We find that wave rays emanating from the upper troposphere in the Indian monsoon region first propagate westward, then divide into the Northern Hemisphere (NH) subtropical westerlies over Asia and the Southern Hemisphere (SH) subtropical westerlies. The wave ray trajectories in GA7 in years of strong Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) are closer to observations than those in GA6. We also find that the upper tropospheric meridional winds over the South Asian monsoon region and western Tibetan Plateau are much better simulated in GA7 than in GA6 owning to the improvement of ISMR and South Asian High (SAH), which leads to a more realistic simulation of the wave rays in GA7. The better simulated circulation teleconnections in GA7 then modulate the vertical motion and moisture transport, and hence affect extratropical rainfall anomalies in the NH and SH. This paper provides new insights for the assessment of tropicalâ€“extratropical teleconnections in models.
