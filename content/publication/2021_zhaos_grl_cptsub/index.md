abstract: "Recent classification of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) into two types, Eastern (EP) and Central (CP) events, has highlighted the importance of the central Pacific. We show here that the local correlation between ENSO subsurface temperatures (Tsub) in the upper 100-m and thermocline depth anomalies breaks down in the central equatorial Pacific, whereas Tsub remains well correlated with sea surface height anomalies. This observed difference in the central equatorial Pacific is simulated by almost all climate models. It arises from a vertically slanted Tsub anomaly structure that is unique to the central equatorial Pacific. We show that this feature is an adiabatic response to wind-driving that is even present in a linear dynamic model, as long as the model has enough baroclinic modes to adequately represent the observed vertical complexity. Our findings have implications for better understanding the different importance of thermocline feedback in CP and EP events."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Here we show that in the central equatorial Pacific ENSO subsurface temperature correlates poorly with thermocline but well with sea surface height. This observed difference occurs commonly in almost all climate models. We demonstrate that it arises from a unique vertically slanted distribution of the subsurface temperature in the central Pacific in response to winds associated with ENSO. Our findings may have implications for better understanding diverse behaviors of ENSO events occurring in central and eastern equatorial Pacific."
