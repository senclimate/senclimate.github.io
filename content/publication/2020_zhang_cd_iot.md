abstract: "Differing from the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) that has sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) of opposing signs over the tropical southeastern and western Indian Ocean, a tripole pattern, characterized by positive (negative) SSTAs over the tropical central (southeastern and western) Indian Ocean, is observed and named the Indian Ocean tripole (IOT). This study proposes the concept of the IOT and further investigates the associated atmospheric and oceanic processes. Using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, the IOT (IOD) is represented by the third (second) leading mode of the monthly SSTAs in the tropical Indian Ocean, explaining about 8.2% (10.3%) of the total variance. The IOT peaks in boreal summer, while the IOD has its mature phase in boreal fall. The spatio-temporal differences, together with the significant separation of these two EOF patterns, illustrate that the IOT is independent of the IOD. Heat budget diagnoses indicate that the anomalous temperature over the southeastern and western Indian Ocean is mainly generated by the net heat flux during April–May and by the total ocean advection in June–August. In contrast, the anomalous temperature is mainly driven by the advection of the mean temperature by the anomalous current in April and the residual term in May–June over the central Indian Ocean, which is replaced by advection of the anomalous temperature by the mean zonal current in July."
