abstract: CO2 mitigation policy is expected to suppress global warming and its climate
  impact; however, this study found that CO2 mitigation could cause an abrupt shortening
  of El Niño periodicity, which enhances the frequency of El Niño and potential influence
  on our society. The abrupt shift is responsible for the southward shift of the Intertropical
  Convergence Zone (ITCZ) due to the CO2 reduction, implying the potential constraint
  of El Niño property on the global energy balance. Even though there is a high uncertainty
  in projected El Niño periodicity under global warming, abrupt shifts in CO2 mitigation
  scenarios can be consistently projected across state-of-the-art climate models.
  Removing CO2 from the atmosphere is emerging as a viable strategy to mitigate global
  warming, yet the responses of the climate system to CO2 reduction remain uncertain.
  One of the most uncertain aspects of El Niño behavior is the change in periodicity
  in response to CO2 forcing [O. Alizadeh, Earth-Sci. Rev. 235, 104246 (2022)]. In
  this study, we show that climate models consistently project an abrupt shortening
  of El Niño periodicity once CO2 reductions commence in ramp-up and ramp-down CO2
  experiments. Besides the contribution of slow mean state changes, this phenomenon
  is shown to be driven by a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone
  (ITCZ) [J.-S. Kug, et al., Nat. Clim. Chang. 12, 47–53 (2022)] and the consequent
  narrowing of El Niño’s spatial pattern, which enhances the effectiveness of ocean
  heat recharge/discharge processes, thereby shortening its periodicity. This suggests
  that the abrupt shift in El Niño periodicity results from a cascading reaction involving
  ITCZ dynamics and El Niño’s spatial configuration. These findings highlight the
  critical role of the global energy balance in shaping El Niño characteristics.
