      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Welcome!

I am a climate scientist specializing in dynamics and impacts of large-scale climate variability and change. 

I have a broad interest in understanding the multi-scale interactions of the Earth system, encompassing the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land surface. Additionally, I explore the societal implications of climate teleconnections and their effects on regional climates and extreme events. Leveraging our understanding of the physical mechanisms governing these interactions, we aim to enhance our ability to predict future climate changes and their impacts. For more details on my research, 

My tools include theoretical approaches, statistical analysis, machine learning and hierarchies of climate modeling, ranging from simple models to the state-of-the-art earth system models.
