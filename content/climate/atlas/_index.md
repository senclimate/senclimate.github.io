The goal of the Atlas of Climatology and Anomaly is to provide the international scientific community and wider general public with an illustrative material in support of climate change studies.

## Datasets

We use monthly gridded observation/reanalysis datasets listed as follows

- **SST**: NOAA Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) V5 obtained from https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.ersst.v5.html
- **Precipitation**: CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) obtained from https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cmap.html


## Methods

- All the climatology is calculated using the period of 1981-2010, unless specifically stated otherwise.
- We also show the detrended SST anomaly by removing the quadratic trend.
